## What

Lerna is a tool to make itinerant computing easier.
It watches for changes to the connected displays and configures X.org to use
what it deems to be the best display.

If

* you use a Linux laptop,
* you use an external monitor, and
* you want to use a single display at a time

then Lerna might be useful to you.
If you want to use multiple displays, it won't be immediately useful, but it
might still be a good starting point.

## How

```sh
$ lerna
```

You'll see output something like this:

    [2014-08-02T04:10:06.592689Z #13059] Switching to DP2
    [2014-08-02T04:11:17.008609Z #13059] DP2 => disconnected
    [2014-08-02T04:11:17.008764Z #13059] Switching to LVDS1

A script is provided to create an Upstart job on Ubuntu; run
`install-ubuntu.sh` as the desktop user (i.e. NOT as root).

You can then use

```sh
$ start lerna
```

to start the job immediately; it should start and stop automatically with your
desktop session thereafter.
